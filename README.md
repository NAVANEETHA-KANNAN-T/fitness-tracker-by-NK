1. Install Required Libraries
Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You can install them using:
pip install streamlit numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
2. Prepare the Dataset
Ensure calories.csv and exercise.csv files are in the same directory as app.py.
These files contain exercise data and calories burned information.
The code merges them using the User_ID column.
3. Run the Streamlit App
Execute the following command in the terminal:
streamlit run app.py
This will open a web interface for user input and data visualization.
